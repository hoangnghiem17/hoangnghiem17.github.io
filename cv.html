        <li>Relevant courses: Data Mining (1.0) | Project Data Science (1.0) | Data Engineering (1.7) | Predictive Analytics (1.7)</li>
        <li>Relevant projects:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Master Thesis:</u> Developed and compared chatbots using Google Dialogflow, Rasa and a custom LLM-based implementation (GPT-4o-mini via LangChain and LangGraph) to assist Frankfurt citizens in sustainable waste disposal. Evaluated each platform based on common chatbot requirements such as NLU, dialogue management, deployment and adaptability. The LLM-based agent featured multimodality, RAG (using FAISS) and tool orchestration.</li>
          <li><u>Machine Learning for Zero Waste:</u> Use of data mining to support the city of Frankfurt to become a certified Zero Waste City. The results were presented to the board of the city of Frankfurt and in the Data Mining Cup where we won the first place. The analysis was done in Python and KNIME and included classifying households in Frankfurt by residual waste generation and characterize those with a high amount with Explainable AI techniques. Furthermore, forecasting was done with various models (ARIMA, Prophet) to predict the amount of waste generated in the future and assess it against Frankfurt's set targets. </li>
          <li><u>BERT Spam Detection:</u> Fine-tuned a BERT model in PyTorch using the Hugging Face Transformers library to classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The project included data preprocessing, tokenization, custom dataset creation and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
